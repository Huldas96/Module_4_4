Hello! 

This is my assignment that is a practise in functional programming.

I deep dived into functional and object oriented programming and learned alot. 

The past few weeks I have been wondering "What is the best way to structure my code?"

And I think I have found that out. Functional programming is really nice! 
You make functions that are pure, re-usable and comfortable to read. 

This was really enlightening and fun. 

I made a really simple sign up page with JS functional programming. 
I tried my best to make the functions as pure as I could.
